We do **not** collect any additional personal information, such as your name, phone number, contacts, or location.  
We do **not** use third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services.  
We do **not** share your email address with third parties.

## Data Storage

Your email and related user data are stored securely using Firebase Authentication and Firebase Firestore services provided by Google. These services comply with international privacy and security standards.
